# Per-former-Self-Attention-endorsed-Person-Re-identification (re-id)
This repository contains a novel self-attention based person re-identification architecture. 
The proposed architecture outperformed CNN based re-id architectures when evaluated on three public re-id benchmarks i.e. Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID and MSMT17. 
The complete code along with pretrained models is shared via this repository.
